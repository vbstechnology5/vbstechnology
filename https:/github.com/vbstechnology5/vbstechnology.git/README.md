## SSH connection

How to deploy on a remote server:

Popular web servers: Apache, Nginx, Tomcat?

1.  Connect to your server using SSH:

    ```bash

    ssh username@server_ip
    ```
2.  Update the package list to ensure you have the latest package information:

    ```bash

    sudo apt update
    ```
3.  Install Apache web server:

    ```bash

    sudo apt install apache2
    ```
4.  Start the Apache service and enable it to start on boot:

    ```bash

    sudo systemctl start apache2
    sudo systemctl enable apache2
    ```
5. To check if Apache is running, open a web browser and enter your server's IP address. You should see the default Apache page.

SFTP client like FileZilla

## Flashing a USB or micro SD
