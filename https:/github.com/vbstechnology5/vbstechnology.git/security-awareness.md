<mark style="color:purple;">**Handling Information**</mark> – Whenever client information is sent out of your organisation, or it is stored on mobile devices, there is a risk. Failure to properly take these risks into consideration can open the door to cyber-criminals and have far reaching consequences for both individuals and organisations. The risks from poor information handling include loss of data, identity theft, financial loss, regulatory fines and sanctions, loss of customer confidence, market position and reputation.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Passwords**</mark> – Passwords are the keys for getting access to almost everything in the digital world, so if a cyber-criminal can obtain a password it makes it easy for them to carry out their work. Failure to use strong passwords represents a serious risk to yourself and your organisation.If criminals gain access to a password, it can lead to everything dangerous.

<mark style="color:blue;">**How to make a good password:**</mark>

• At least 15 characters long&#x20;

• Use a combination of special characters, numbers, and letters, or consider using a phrase&#x20;

• Make it random; avoid using repetition, <mark style="color:blue;">**dictionary passwords**</mark> or usernames&#x20;

• Use different passwords for different accounts

• Change passwords regularly&#x20;

• Use multi-factor authentication if it is available (ex:2FA)

• Use <mark style="color:red;">**Bitwarden**</mark> (Password manager) to generate strong passwords and store it securely&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">**What are dictionary passwords:**</mark> Big companies sell their data every year including passwords etc...So hackers take the data and put it in the world dictionnary passwords (txt or csv file)and then they will try bruteforce attacks (guessing your password using a bot and the dictionnary file)

## <mark style="color:green;">5. Additional things to avoid being a victim</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">**Slow down**</mark> – Never let the implied urgency influence your careful review of an email or a pop-up on a website or on your computer. A phishing email or a bogus antivirus alert will try to get you to act first and think later. If the message conveys a sense of urgency, it is even more reason to be <mark style="color:red;">**A MALICIOUS THING**</mark>.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Check the facts**</mark> – Be suspicious of an unsolicited phone call or email from a service provider and carry out due diligence checks. If it appears to be from a company you use, do your own research. Use a search engine to go to the real company’s site.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Confirm information requests**</mark> – Ignore any email requesting financial information or passwords, and never provide personal information, unless you expected the request and you can validate the source. Check website security – When accessing a website for the first time, carry out some basic checks to see if it is safe.&#x20;

• Check the address bar to see whether the site is verified

• Check if HTTPS is used in the web address  (it can Be insecure also)

• Check the website with Google Safe Browsing www.google.com/transparencyreport/safebrowsing/diagnostic&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Reject offers of help**</mark> – Legitimate companies and organisations do not make contact to provide help. If you did not specifically request assistance from the sender, consider any offer to ’help’ a scam.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Be aware of links in emails**</mark> – Curiosity leads to carelessness. If you don’t know what the email is about, clicking a link is a bad choice. If you believe the link is genuine, stay in control; hovering over links in email will show the actual web address. Find the website yourself using a search engine to be sure the link is actually going to take you somewhere safe.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Don’t assume an email sender is legitimate**</mark> – Email hacking and spoofing is common. Even when the sender appears to be someone you know, if you aren’t expecting an email with a link or attachment, check with that person before clicking on links or downloading.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Keep client information secure**</mark> – Ensure that client information sent externally is only ever sent to an appropriately authorised entity. Keeping client data on mobile devices should be avoided wherever possible and where it is necessary to keep client data on a mobile device, the data should always be encrypted(protected).

<mark style="color:purple;">**Before sharing information**</mark> – Consider the following before sharing information:

• Is this information sensitive?

• What is it going to be used for?

• Do you have permission to share this information?&#x20;

• Is it legal to share?

• Are you only sharing what is necessary?

• Is sharing the information in line with LAL policy?

<mark style="color:purple;">**Installing programs or apps is risky**</mark> – Only install authorised programs or apps, make sure you do a search or ask someone knowledgeable to be 100% sure it is safe before proceeding.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Public Wi-Fi is unsafe**</mark> - Data over a public Wi-Fi network is often unencrypted and unsecured. If you must use a public Wi-Fi hotspot, also use a virtual private network (VPN) to secure your connection – a VPN creates a “secure tunnel” where data sent to and from your device is encrypted, making all that data secure. Don’t log into password-protected websites that contain sensitive information when using a public Wi-Fi connection\\

<mark style="color:purple;">**Physical Security:**</mark>

* Lock your computer when away from your desk.
* Keep sensitive documents secure.
